Summarize the incident in the second section of the report. Provide as many details and facts as possible in your documentation. When writing the documentation, be sure to:

Avoid using strong emotional language (good, terrible, awful, etc.).

Include as many facts about the issue as you can, including where the incident occurred, how it happened, whether anyone witnessed it, how it was discovered, etc.

Indicate your sources for information and evidence.

Writing accurate and detailed documentation for cybersecurity incidents can serve as a reference point for other cybersecurity analysts. Additionally, quality documentation can be used to educate other employees about cybersecurity measures taken within the company when incidents occur and can help businesses comply with various security audits.
