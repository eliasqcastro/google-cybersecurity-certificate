As one of the cybersecurity analysts in this scenario, you are tasked with writing an incident report for this security event. Using the tcpdump log file, determine which network protocol is identified in the packet captures during the investigation. You will use what you learned about the four layers of the TCP/IP model and which protocols happen at each layer. If needed, you can review the video and reading about the TCP/IP model to use as guides for your response. Then review the tcpdump traffic log and record which protocol you identified in the first section of the security incident report template.
