After documenting the incident, write one recommendation to help your organization prevent brute force attacks in the future.

Some of the common security methods used to prevent brute force attacks include:

- Requiring strong passwords

- Enforcing two-factor authentication (2FA)

- Monitoring login attempts

- Requiring more frequent password changes

- Disallowing previous passwords from being used

- Limiting the number of login attempts

Select one security measure, and explain why it is effective in section three of the security incident report template.

The more safety measures that are in place, the less likely a malicious actor will be able to access sensitive information.
